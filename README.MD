# Java Pair Programming Exercise

We'll run through this pair programming exercise together.

Please write code and documentation as you would when programming for a professional setting. 

## Multi-Currency Invoice Calculator

You need to build a service that:
1. Calculates the total cost of items in different currencies 
1. Applying currency exchange rates
1. Returns a final invoice total in the desired output currency.

### Requirements
1. Store Item Information
   2. Accept an item, price (numerical) and a currency code (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY, etc.).
   3. Discuss pros and cons of using different data structures to represent items (Java Objects vs raw strings)
1. Set Exchange Rates
   2. Create/use a data structure to hold exchange rates
1. Final Invoice Total
   2. Create a method that gets the total invoice amount in desired currency type.

### TDD
We'll use Test-Driven Development to guide our development:
1. Create unit tests that are responsible testing the methods you create
2. 

[//]: # (1. A method that outputs the itemized list and each items cost in the currency requested. It should be ordered by cost)
[//]: # (1. Create useful util methods)
[//]: # (   2. Create a method to calculate prices of multiple items)
[//]: # (   1. Create a method to calculate an items price in another currency)
